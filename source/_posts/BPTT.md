# Foreword
网上看了挺多BPTT中文教程，感觉云里雾里。后来看了油管上的两位三哥的讲解，感觉十分通透。究竟是我中文水平退化，还是搜索的姿势不对？😅

I read a lot of Chinese tutorials online about BPTT, but unfortunately, they all made me lost. Things changed until I saw two tutorial videos  on YouTube made by Indian, which are quite clear and insightful. I wonder is it due to my degrading Chinese, or due to my incorrect searching way?
